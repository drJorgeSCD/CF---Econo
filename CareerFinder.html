	<p>Econo is a company with a single mission that is decrease the percentage of world poverty. Our plan is to have training buildings to train people who don't have a job and want to progress. We focus on countries with low resources to help their population gain the skills they probably need to work. It's not a college but it ain't too far from being one. People from around the country can sign up for our program and after training, they can as well work on our facilities. We are in charge of finding jobs for these people and make them more sustainable for themselves and families.</p>
