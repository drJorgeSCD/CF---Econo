        Jason Batista:
         My name is Jason Batista and I am 17 years old.
         I come from a Dominican household but was born in the United States. The school I attend is Information Technology High School and I am currently a Senior at Info
          Tech High School. The academy I am in is the CTE academy and Ive been part of this academy for 3 years.
           My hobbies are usually just playing video games, hanging out with friends and skateboarding.
          I'm not sure yet what my dream is but hopefully I'll figure it out, but my goals are to graduate from high school with an Advanced Regents Diploma and get into a good college.
           So far the three years being part of this program has taught me a lot of new things a regular class wouldn't.
            Ive learned how to work as a community with others, how actual jobs are and act, how to code, how to write a resume and a lot more useful things for life.
           The CTE academy prepares you for a great future ahead with all of the useful tips and hard work you have to put in to succeed.
